# MulkyH-CV

This repository contains a single HTML file that serves as a fully functional, interactive personal portfolio website. The entire website is built as a challenge to demonstrate how much can be achieved using only one HTML file, without any external HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.

üîß Tech Stack
1. Tailwind CSS ‚Äì Utility-first CSS framework included via CDN for styling.
2. JavaScript ‚Äì Used for interactive features like theme toggling and animated elements.
3. HTML5 ‚Äì The entire structure, logic, and style are encapsulated in a single .html file.

üéØ Challenge Goals
1. Create a modern, responsive portfolio using only one HTML file.
2. Showcase how far you can push the boundaries of clean design and interactivity without a build system or multiple file structure.
3. Keep everything modular and readable despite the file size constraint.

‚ú® Features
1. Responsive layout for all screen sizes.
2. Live animated gradient background.
3. Dark/light theme toggle.
4. Interactive project section with hover effects.
5. Chat-like AI UI element for hints and navigation help.

üìÅ Why One HTML?
This was an intentional constraint to explore:
1. How minimal a working project setup can be.
2. The efficiency and speed of prototyping without file splitting.
3. A throwback to simpler web development workflows with a modern twist.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
While this challenge is a great exercise in minimalism, it is strongly recommended to split code into separate files and use a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) for any scalable or production-level projects. Externalizing code improves maintainability, performance, and developer experience.
