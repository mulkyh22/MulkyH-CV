# 🌐 One-File CV/Portfolio Website

This repository contains a single HTML file that serves as a fully functional, interactive personal portfolio website.  
It was created as a challenge to demonstrate how much can be achieved using only **one HTML file**, without any external HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework included via CDN for styling.  
- **JavaScript** – Used for interactive features like theme toggling and animations.  
- **HTML5** – The entire structure, logic, and styling is encapsulated in a single `.html` file.  

---

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

- Build a modern, responsive portfolio/CV using only one HTML file.
- Push the boundaries of clean design and interactivity **without** a build system or multiple files.
- Maintain readability and usability despite the file size and format constraints.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Responsive layout across all screen sizes  
- 🎨 Live animated gradient background  
- 🌗 Dark/light theme toggle  
- 🖱️ Interactive project section with hover effects  
- 🤖 Chat-like AI UI for hints and navigation assistance  

---

## 📁 Why Only One HTML File?

This constraint was intentional, designed to explore:

- How minimal a working project setup can be
- Rapid prototyping without file splitting or build tools
- A modern twist on the simplicity of early web development

---

## ⚠️ Note

While this one-file approach is a great exercise in **minimalism** and creative freedom in one file, it is **not** recommended for production-level projects. For scalability and maintainability, consider using:

- Code splitting into HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Component-based frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, or **Svelte**
- Proper build tools and versioning systems
